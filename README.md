# KD-explorer
Final project for CSGY 9223 Spring 2021 by Bruno Coelho (bgc5612) and Guan-de Wu (gw2145).

## Structure
This project is broken into two parts, modeling and the frontend. For each one:
- frontend/ This folder Contains the code for the react app used in our interactive visualization tool. It also contains it's own README with information about running or deploying our app.
-  KD_Models.ipynb - Contains the code for downloading and training our student/teacher models and generating the necessary files as output. These files are then uploaded to Google Cloud Storage and used directly in the frontend.

## Overview of running the Interface
```shell
cd ./frontend
yarn
yarn start
```

We also attach our final report PDF.
